My Virtual World
The world that I created was intended to be a simple fairground. The purpose of this world was to bring the user on a virtual experience of a fair, as if it was the real thing, with the ability to interact and listen to the environment created. As such there are several sections to interact with such as the food stand, the bowling game or even the music tent to stimulate a real fair experience.
The first additional feature that I added was music when you enter the large tent, as I had setup a stage and 2 speakers, to simulate a music room. The reason for this is that to truly be immersed in a VR world you need to have more of your primary senses stimulated. As such it can tell your brain that you are truly there and not just looking at a screen on some VR headset, this is very important for the user, as they want a truly immersive experience.
The second additional feature that I added was the implementation of interactable objects. The reason for this feature was so that the fair ground could be come more enjoyable due to in becoming interactable, as such there is an interactable bowling ball and pins for the user to play with, as well as food items that can be picked up.
However, when looking at the virtual world that I created with hindsight, there are still some issues with. One of which is how there is only a single playable game, where at a fair there would tend to be several different games. Also, outside of the fair past the treeline is just an infinite grey void, which could be quite distracting if noticed by a user and ruin the immersion. As well, when initially making the interactive objects, grabbing thing felt weird as in the project originally the user had “no hands”, which made things hard in perspective and understanding depth became difficult, as such I added hands to the character model.
